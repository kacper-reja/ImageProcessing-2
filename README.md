# Description

The goal of this project was to find the best possible classification system for a given set of 6 different leaves types images using feature vectors and machine learning algorithms. Number of images per each type of leaf was from 38 to 97.<br/><br/>
The approach taken in this project was to combine Hu Moments, Haralick Texture and Color Histogram feature vectors and train few machine learning models using combintation of those vectors.
